## _Getting the Foundation right for React_ ⚛️

##### _Session 2_ on Objects, Functions, Scopes and Closures

##### 22nd July , 2021

---

# Let's Begin 🎬

---

# Everything is Object in JS

_Except:_ Primitives: (boolean, number and string), and undefined

---

#### did you know typeof null === "object" ?

---

# What is an Object?

- An object is a collection of properties

- Property is an association between a key and a value

- Every object has a type

- Just like real world objects

---

# 🌼 🏠 🚗 🔪 🎈 📱

# 🪔 📷 🎞️ 🎥 🔎 📔

# 💳 ✏️ 📅 🔒 ⛏️ 🧲

---

### Depending on the type...

---

# Properties can be categorized as

- Just Plain Property 😄

- Property with behaviour ( methods )

---

##### Property Key is IT, Property Value is WHAT

---

## An object of Type Car 🚗

##### Properties: `Engine Capcity, Color, Size, Type, etc...`

##### Behaviours: `turn, start, stop, accelerate, change gear, move, etc...`

---

### Sub Types

# 🏎️ 🚗 🚓

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
{
  model: "Safari",
  make: "Tata"
  year: 2012,
  color: "grey"
  start: function() { //method
      return "Wroom..."
  }
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Procedure

A set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value

---

# Procedure to cook Dal Fry? 🥘

- Take 200g of Toor dal

- Soak in water

- ask mom to make 😅

---

# Functions

- are procedures

- that take some input and return an output

- there must be a 👫 between input <-> output

---

## makeDalFry(dal, quantity)

- ✅ Yummy Dal Fry 😇

- ❌ French Fries 😰

---

#### Type of inputs must be strict => TypeScript

## makeDalFry(dal: Dal, quantity: number) :🥘

---

# Functions continued..

- Basic building block in JS 🧱

- Are also a type of Objects

- First-class objects

- Callable Objects

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
{
  model: "Safari",
  make: "Tata"
  year: 2012,
  color: "grey"
  start: function() {
      return "Wroom..."
  }
}
```

```diff 6[3:19]

```

# Scopes

- Scope means boundary

- We need some way to tell what is a boundary

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
{
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Block Scope { }

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
if (dalFryIsGood) {
  const messageToTell = "It's delicious!";
  console.log(messageToTell); // "It's delicious!"
} else {
  console.log("----silence-----");
}

console.log(messageToTell); // throws ReferenceError

while (youFeelLikeEatingJunkFood) {
  // think about side effects ( used in React too! )
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Never use `var`. It's not block scoped

## Also, think about hoisting

---

# Function Scope 🎬

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
function walkInPark(duration) {
  //till you feel like
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Function Hoisting

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
1;

sayHello();
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Namaskaram!");
}

2;

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Namaskaram!");
}
sayHello();
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### ❗ Function Declarations are hoisted ❗

### ✅ Function Expressions are not hoisted

---

Expressions vs Declarations?

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
sayHello(); // Error, sayHello is not defined
const sayHello = function () {
  console.log("Namaskaram!");
};
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Back to scopes

---

# Global scope 🌎

- top in browser

- Go to Chrome Dev tools and see them

---

#### Lexical Scope, Nested Scope and Closures

---

### Closures

Whenever you create a function within another function, you have created a closure.

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
function outerFunction() {
  const outer = `I see the outer variable!`;

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outer);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

outerFunction()();
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Shorter Version

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
function outerFunction() {
  const privateVariable = `I see the outer private variable!`;

  return function innerFunction() {
    console.log(privateVariable);
  };
}

outerFunction()(); // I see the outer variable!
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Closures have access to the variables in the outer function

- Are used to :

  - To control side effects

  - To create private variables

---

## Controlling side effects with closures

- Something aside from returning a value from a function

- Like :

  - `console.log()`

  - ajax requests

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
function (x) {
  console.log('Thank you ( is a side effect 😅 ) ')
}

```

</CodeSurfer>
