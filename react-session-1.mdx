# Let's Begin 🎬

---

# Basics 0

- The web works mainly on the HTTP/S protocol

- HTTP is a stateless protocol

- HTTP works on Client-Server Architecture

- One way data communication ( not mandatorily though eg: web sockets )

---

# Requests: 😀 ✅-> 🖥️

# 😀 <- 🖥️ :Responds

---

# 😏 <- ❌ 🖥️ :Requests

# 😏 -- 🖥️

---

# Basics 1

- Server's job is to serve. Doesn't matter what.

- Some servers respond with JSON. Some with .html files or even .js files!

---

# Basics 2

- Clients ( browsers ) need .js files.

- Some clients ( mobile devices ) also support running other file extensions .apk / .ipa

---

# HTML 🏗️

- Markup language => Like the structure of a building.

- With a weak strucutre, no amount of fancy makeups can cover up.

- It's always good to use the latest 'materials' ( tags here! )

---

# CSS 🌈

- Like the paint / texture of a building.

- Know why its called Cascading ???

---

# JavaScript 🕹️

- Like the switches and taps in a building.

- Primarily was used as a scripting language to do simple things in the browser

- Now supports Imperative (how) and Declarative (what) styles of programming

- ECMA - The standards defining committee [Click for more info](https://www.greycampus.com/blog/programming/java-script-versions)

- Where does it run?

---

# Basics 3

- Where does JS run? Browser!

- What happens when you hit a URL?

- Do we need JS to show a static HTML page? No! ❌

- I can have a painted building, without switches and taps.

- Switches and taps are not tied ( coupled ) to a building

  - They can even be used independently

---

# Excercise 1

- Go to [Sadhguru](https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en) -> Disable JS -> Reload

---

# Excercise 2

- Go to [Quotes](https://sadhguru-quotes.vercel.app/) -> Disable JS -> Reload

---

# Basics 3

- When you download a mobile app, it takes some time.

- Similarly if your bundle size is large, it takes time for it to come down.

- Types of Page Rendering

  - SSR - Server Side Rendering
  - CSR - Client Side Rendering
  - Static sites ( _Next_ calls it SSG )

---

# DOM 📄

- Data representation of Objects that constitue a document ( eg: web page )

- Can represent HTML or XML

- In a nutshell, it's programming interface ( anything that abstracts out complexity )

- Browsers implement the standards defined by W3C DOM and WHATWG DOM.

  (that's why the same apis work on major browsers, except IE 😄)

---

# DOM Vruksha

# 🌳

---

# Web APIs 😮

## https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

---

# _Interfaces_ , _Abstraction_ ... What???

- They are just jargons. Don't worry too much about the 'words' and 'definitions'

- But everything in programming is all about:

  - Clear and concise code 🥽 , reusability and modularity 🧱

- And for that we need design patterns, abstractions and interfaces.

# Interface example in DOM

<CodeSurfer>

```js
<html>
<body>

<p id="p1">
This is a text.
This is a text.
</p>

<input type="button" value="Hide text"
onclick="document.getElementById('p1').style.visibility='hidden'">

<input type="button" value="Show text"
onclick="document.getElementById('p1').style.visibility='visible'">

</body>
</html>
```

<CodeSurfer>

```js
//index.html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Simple List</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="list">

  </div>

  <form id="new-item-form">
    <label for="item-input">New Item</label>
    <input type="text" id="item-input">
    <button type="submit">Add Item</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

<CodeSurfer>

```js
//script.js
const form = document.querySelector("#new-item-form");
const list = document.querySelector("#list");
const input = document.querySelector("#item-input");

// 0. When I submit the form add a new element
form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  // 1. Create a new item
  const item = document.createElement("div");
  item.innerText = input.value;
  item.classList.add("list-item");

  // 2. Add that item to the list
  list.appendChild(item);

  // 3. Clear input
  input.value = "";

  // 4. Setup event listener to delete item when clicked
  item.addEventListener("click", () => {
    item.remove();
  });
});
```

</CodeSurfer>

<CodeSurfer>

```js
.list-item {
  cursor: pointer;
  width: min-content;
}

.list-item:hover {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```
