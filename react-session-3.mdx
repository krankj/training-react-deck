# Namaskaram üôè

## _Getting the Foundation right for React_ ‚öõÔ∏è

##### _Session 3_ on Async Javascript

##### 27th July , 2021

---

# Let's Begin üé¨

---

### JavaScript is Synchronous, Blocking and Single Threaded üòÆ

---

### What?

- It's the APIs that browsers provide that make it

---

### Asynchronous, Non-Blocking and still Single Threaded üßµ

---

### Programs, Processes and Threads üôÑ

---

### Programs, Processes and Threads üôÉ

- Program is a set of instructions
- Process is a program in execution (in memory, ready to be processed)
- Threads are contained inside a process
- (threads share the same resources, processes do not)

---

### Threads ( software )

A process with two threads of execution, running on one processor

  style={{
    width: "200px",
    height: "200px",
    marginTop: "20px",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
/>

###### Image Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)

---

##### Machine may support multiple threads ‚úÖ

##### OS may support multiple threads ‚úÖ

##### But the language must also support it, and a programmer must use it ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

### `window.alert` Blocks your main thread üìü

---

### Thread üßµ

- Programs 'use' threads ( provided by language )

- JavaScript is single threaded

- It can still use worker threads

---

# Synchronous vs Asynchronous

- ###### Synchronous by definition means occurring at the _same time_.

- ###### Asynchronous by definition means _not_ occurring at the _same time_.

But...

---

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous in üñ•Ô∏è

- ###### Synchronous in programming means occurring in _sequence_

- ###### Asynchronous in programming mean means _not_ occurring in _sequence_.

---

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous continued...

<Image
  src={syncAsyncImage}
  style={{
    width: "50%",
    height: "30%",
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
/>

---

# Blocking vs Non Blocking

- ###### Suppose you are driving üèéÔ∏è

- ###### And you encounter a toll gate üöè

---

# Blocking üõë

- ###### Now , you are going to 'block' the toll gate ( main thread ) for a while depending

  - ###### on various factors like: FastTag, cash change, etc.

- ###### Blocking is always in contrast to others who also want to go through the same gate.

---

# Solutions?

- ###### You could have multiple gates ( cores in a processor ), but similar problems still exit.

- ###### You could get a 'promise' from the car owner that 'I will get back to you'

- ###### Now, a single toll gate will not stop anybody from moving,
  - ###### but will act as a checkpoint to collect a written promise.

---

# Promise

- He _has_ promised me to marry üíë

  - He did marry üë´ -----> Fulfilled

  - He later tells that he doesn't want to marry üôç ------> Rejected

  - He doesn't inform anything üò† -------> Rejected (after a timeout)

  - Till any of the above occur -------> Pending

  - Fulfilled or Rejected => Settled

---

# Promise

- He (task) _has_ promised me (JavaScript) to marry üíë

---

#### This is the basis of _Non Blocking Asynchronous_ Code

- ###### Non Blocking since I am not blocking ( majorly ) others from 'moving'.

- ###### Asynchronous ( from main thread perspective ) since depending
  ###### on a person the promise may take different times (which could be sync/async) to
  - Be in 'Pending'
  - After which it will either
    - Fulfill
    - Reject

---

#### Promises are similar to call backs, but

- ###### they allow us to chain multiple async operations together using `.then()`

- ###### helps us avoid the messy 'pyramid of doom' or the call back hell

- ###### and many others

---

#### You already are familiar with async code:

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
console.log("registering click handler");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("get click");
});

console.log("all done");
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Async Function example

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function hello() {
  const h1 = new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve("1"), 1000)
  );
  const h2 = new Promise(
    (_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject("2"), 500) //note the timeout
  );
  const results = [await h1, await h2]; // ‚ùå
  // Use Promise.all or Promise.allSettled instead.
}
hello().catch((e) => {
  console.error("Error occurred!", e);
});
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Promises: Executor and Consumer

- Executor => `(resolve, reject) => {}`

- Consumer: `.then, .catch and .finally`

---

### Promises: There can be only a single result or an error

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("done");

  reject(new Error("‚Ä¶")); // ignored
  setTimeout(() => resolve("‚Ä¶")); // ignored
});
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Promise: Classic Error

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
});

promise.then(function (result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function (result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});

promise.then(function (result) {
  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;
});
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Chaining is used much more often.

---

# Microtasks and Microtask Queue

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
let promise = Promise.resolve();

promise.then(() => alert("promise done!"));

alert("code finished"); // this alert shows first
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Execution of a task is initiated only when nothing else is running.

---

# Async/await

- Special syntax to work with promises

---

# Async function

- A function that always returns a promise

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  return 1;
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Is same as

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Await

- Works only inside async functions

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
// works only inside async functions
let value = await promise;
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

# Example

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000);
  });

  let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

  alert(result); // "done!"
}

f();
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

## Common must knows

- Can‚Äôt use `await` in regular functions

- `await` won‚Äôt work in the top-level code

- You will have to wrap it in a IIFE

## Error Handling

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  await Promise.reject(new Error("Aiyo!"));
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  throw new Error("Aiyo!");
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

### Which means we can use `try/catch`

---

<CodeSurfer>

```js
async function f() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch("http://random-url");
  } catch (err) {
    alert(err); // TypeError: failed to fetch
  }
}

f();
```

</CodeSurfer>

## Thanks! üôèüèΩ

### Let's `await` till the next session
